--------------------------------------
update schemas
--------------------------------------
make sure that calander items are being read from and written to the configured firestore db.

if a user has no groups stored in the database, create a new group named "Care Bear Central" and save it for them in the database

when you create a group, the schema must include these fields: createdAt: timestamp and createdBy, which stores the userID of the user who created the group

when you create a user, the schema must include these fields: createdAt: timestamp, authProvider: string, which stores a string describing the type of authentication used by the user, name: string, which stores the user name if we know it or 'guest user' if we dont, email: string, which stores the email address if we know it or 'unknown@carebear.com' if we don't


--------------------------------------
add Create Group functionality
--------------------------------------
when I click the "create a group" button it redirects to a dead url. clicking the button should bring up a dialog box to ask user for a new for the new group, with an OK and Cancel buttons on the dialog. If the user adds a new name and clicks OK, then create a new group with the name from the dialog box, add the group to the collection, save the group into the db and then switch to that group in the calender.


--------------------------------------
change default placeholder on Input 
--------------------------------------
on the create-group-dailog.tsx replace the current Input placeholder 
value with a single random selection from the following list:
Cheer Bear, Christmas Wishes Bear, Daydream Bear, Birthday Bear, Best Friend Bear, Destiny Bear, Funshine Bear, Harmony Bear, Heartstrong Bear


--------------------------------------
change color scheme
--------------------------------------
each event should have a background color selected at random from a list 
of (6) colors that go along with the care bear theme of the app

the events should not have white text, they are too hard to see. 
change the font color to something darker


--------------------------------------
add Join a Group functionality
--------------------------------------
when a user clicks on "join a group", show a dialog with a textbox labeled 
'Enter a Group ID'. There will also be an ok and cancel button. If the user 
enters a value in the group id and clicks the ok button, then close the 
dialog box and perform a query on the db to see if there is a group with 
that same groupid. if the group exists, then add the calendar groupid to 
the user's groups array. then update the app to show the new group in the 
list and select that group for display
