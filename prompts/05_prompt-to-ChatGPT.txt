============================

Would you like me to make this more technical and structured like a spec (with Firestore schema, function triggers, etc.), or keep it in this natural language app-generation style for Firebase Studio?

============================

YES

============================

Got it üëç I‚Äôll expand the Firebase Studio prompt into a more technical, spec-like format including suggested Firestore schema, Cloud Function triggers, and overall architecture. That way Firebase Studio has clear guidance to scaffold the app.

Would you like me to also include a step-by-step build outline for Firebase Studio (e.g. ‚ÄúCreate Firestore collections ‚Üí Configure Auth ‚Üí Add Cloud Functions ‚Üí Deploy Hosting‚Äù), so it can act like a checklist?

=======================================

YES

=======================================

Firebase Studio Build Outline
1. Project Setup

 Create a new Firebase project named Friend Group Social Calendar.

 Enable Firebase Hosting for Vue.js frontend.

  "authProvider": "google|apple|facebook",
  "groups": []
}

3. Firestore Setup

Create the following collections:

/users/{userId}

Stores profile info + group memberships.

/groups/{groupId}

{

  "inviteLink": "string",
  "members": ["userId1", "userId2", ...]
}


/groups/{groupId}/events/{eventId}

{
  "title": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "location": "string",
